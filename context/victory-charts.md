Getting Started
Installation
Start by installing the peer dependencies of victory-native â€“ React Native Reanimated, Gesture Handler, and Skia:

yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler @shopify/react-native-skia

For Reanimated, you'll need to add "react-native-reanimated/plugin" to your plugins list in your babel.config.js config file.

Then install victory-native:

yarn add victory-native

Now you should be ready to go.

Your first chart
Let's create a basic line chart on a Cartesian grid. Let's mock out a little bit of mock data for "high temperature" for each day in a month:
```tsx
const DATA = Array.from({ length: 31 }, (_, i) => ({
  day: i,
  highTmp: 40 + 30 * Math.random(),
}));
```
Instantiate a chart
Now, we'll use the CartesianChart component and pass in our data, specifying which property we'll be using for our x (independent variable) and y (dependent variable) keys.

import { View } from "react-native";
import { CartesianChart } from "victory-native";

// ...
```tsx
function MyChart() {
  return (
    <View style={{ height: 300 }}>
      // ðŸ‘‡ start our chart
      <CartesianChart data={DATA} xKey="day" yKeys={["highTmp"]} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
At this point, we're you'll just see a blank view, since we aren't rendering anything useful to our charting canvas.

Add a line to the chart
The CartesianChart uses a render function for its children prop. To render content inside of the Cartesian chart, you return Skia elements from the children render function. We'll use the Line component from victory-native to render a line path using our temperature data.

```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { CartesianChart, Line } from "victory-native";

function MyChart() {
  return (
    <View style={{ height: 300 }}>
      <CartesianChart data={DATA} xKey="day" yKeys={["highTmp"]}>
        {/* ðŸ‘‡ render function exposes various data, such as points. */}
        {({ points }) => (
          // ðŸ‘‡ and we'll use the Line component to render a line path.
          <Line points={points.highTmp} color="red" strokeWidth={3} />
        )}
      </CartesianChart>
    </View>
  );
}
```
Now we've got a line path to represent our daily high temperature data!

Add some axes
You might want some axes to make your line graph a bit easier to read and interpret. The CartesianChart offers out-of-the-box support for axes and grids to make it easy to get up and running with some axes. Let's add some now.
```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { CartesianChart, Line } from "victory-native";
// ðŸ‘‡ import a font file you'd like to use for tick labels
import inter from "../assets/inter-medium.ttf";

function MyChart() {
  const font = useFont(inter, 12);

  return (
    <View style={{ height: 300 }}>
      <CartesianChart
        data={DATA}
        xKey="day"
        yKeys={["highTmp"]}
        // ðŸ‘‡ pass the font, opting in to axes.
        axisOptions={{ font }}
      >
        {({ points }) => (
          <Line points={points.highTmp} color="red" strokeWidth={3} />
        )}
      </CartesianChart>
    </View>
  );
}
```
And now we've got some axes and grid lines!

Adding a tooltip
You might also want to give your users a way to interact with the line chart you've created. Handling user gestures can be complex, especially in canvas-like drawing context. Victory Native helps streamline this for you. To build a basic tooltip, we'll do three things.

Create a ChartPressState instance using the useChartPressState hook from victory-native.
Pass our state variable into our <CartesianChart /> element.
Use the Reanimated shared values from the ChartPressState instance in a custom ToolTip component that we'll create to create our tooltip element.
We'll start by creating our ChartPressState instance and pass it to our chart element.

// ...
import { /*...*/ useChartPressState } from "victory-native";

function MyChart() {
  // ...
  // ðŸ‘‡ create our chart press state
  const { state, isActive } = useChartPressState({ x: 0, y: { highTmp: 0 } });

  return (
    // ...
    <CartesianChart
      // ...
      chartPressState={state} // ðŸ‘ˆ and pass it to our chart.
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </CartesianChart>
    // ...
  );
}

// ...

Then we'll create a ToolTip component that uses some Reanimated SharedValues from our state variable.

import type { SharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";
// ...

function ToolTip({ x, y }: { x: SharedValue<number>; y: SharedValue<number> }) {
  return <Circle cx={x} cy={y} r={8} color="black" />;
}

And we'll conditionally show an instance of this component when the chart press is active:

// ...
import { /*...*/ useChartPressState } from "victory-native";

function MyChart() {
  // ...
  const { state, isActive } = useChartPressState({ x: 0, y: { highTmp: 0 } });

  return (
    // ...
    <CartesianChart
      // ...
      chartPressState={state}
    >
      {
        (/*...*/) => (
          <>
            {/* ðŸ‘‡ Conditionally show our tooltip and pass values. */}
            {isActive ? (
              <ToolTip x={state.x.position} y={state.y.highTmp.position} />
            ) : null}
          </>
        )
      }
    </CartesianChart>
    // ...
  );
}

// ...

With this in place, we have a rather simple tooltip UI:

Putting this all together, we have something like the following:
```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { CartesianChart, Line, useChartPressState } from "victory-native";
import { Circle, useFont } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import type { SharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";
import inter from "../../assets/inter-medium.ttf"; // Wherever your font actually lives

function MyChart() {
  const font = useFont(inter, 12);
  const { state, isActive } = useChartPressState({ x: 0, y: { highTmp: 0 } });

  return (
    <View style={{ height: 300 }}>
      <CartesianChart
        data={DATA}
        xKey="day"
        yKeys={["highTmp"]}
        axisOptions={{
          font,
        }}
        chartPressState={state}
      >
        {({ points }) => (
          <>
            <Line points={points.highTmp} color="red" strokeWidth={3} />
            {isActive && (
              <ToolTip x={state.x.position} y={state.y.highTmp.position} />
            )}
          </>
        )}
      </CartesianChart>
    </View>
  );
}

function ToolTip({ x, y }: { x: SharedValue<number>; y: SharedValue<number> }) {
  return <Circle cx={x} cy={y} r={8} color="black" />;
}

const DATA = Array.from({ length: 31 }, (_, i) => ({
  day: i,
  highTmp: 40 + 30 * Math.random(),
}));

```

Line (Component)
The Line component takes a PointsArray prop, as well as some options for styling/animating, and returns a Skia Path element to draw the line chart.

Example
```tsx
import { CartesianChart, Line } from "victory-native";
import DATA from "./my-data";

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <CartesianChart data={DATA} xKey="x" yKeys={["y"]}>
      {({ points }) => (
        //ðŸ‘‡ pass a PointsArray to the Line component, as well as options.
        <Line
          points={points.y}
          color="red"
          strokeWidth={3}
          animate={{ type: "timing", duration: 300 }}
        />
      )}
    </CartesianChart>
  );
}
```
Props
points
A PointsArray array that comes from a field of the points object exposed the children render function of CartesianChart, as illustrated in the example above.

animate
The animate prop takes a PathAnimationConfig object and will animate the path when the points changes.

curveType
A CurveType value that indicates the type of curve should be drawn (e.g. linear or natural).

connectMissingData
The connectMissingData: boolean value that indicates whether missing data should be interpolated for the resulting Path. If set to true, the output will be a single, connected line chart path (even if there are missing data values). If set to false, if there is missing data values â€“ the path will consist of multiple disconnected "parts".

connectMissingData={false}

Interpolate missing data

connectMissingData={true}

Interpolate missing data

children
A children pass-thru that will be rendered inside of the Skia Path element, useful if you'd like to make e.g. a gradient path.

Paint properties
The Line component will also pass the following painting props down to the underlying Path component:

color
strokeWidth
strokeJoin
strokeCap
blendMode
strokeMiter
opacity
antiAlias
